1) Project Setup:
    Install Node.js and MongoDB on your development machine.
    Set up a new project directory.
    Initialize a new Node.js project using npm or yarn.

2) Dependencies and Packages:
    Create a package.json file using the package manager of your choice.
    Install the required dependencies:
    Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.
    Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
    Other packages you may need, such as body-parser, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, etc.

3) Database Setup:
    Connect to your MongoDB database using Mongoose.
    Define the necessary schemas and models for your social media app, such as User, Post, Comment, etc.
    Set up relationships between the models using references or embedding, depending on your app's requirements.
    Authentication and User Management:

4) Implement user registration and login functionality.
   Use bcrypt to securely hash and store user passwords.
   Generate JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization.
   Create routes for user registration, login, logout, and profile management.

5) Post Management:
   Implement functionality to create, read, update, and delete posts.
   Define routes for creating new posts, retrieving posts, updating posts, and deleting posts.
   Associate posts with the corresponding user using the user ID or reference.

6) Comment Management:
    Add the ability to add comments to posts.
    Define routes for creating comments, retrieving comments, and deleting comments.
    Associate comments with the corresponding user and post using IDs or references.
    Like/Dislike and Follow/Unfollow Functionality:

7) Implement the ability for users to like or dislike posts.
    Enable users to follow or unfollow other users.
    Create routes for handling likes, dislikes, follows, and unfollows.

8) API Design and Documentation:
    Design a RESTful API for your social media app.
    Define routes, endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.
    Document your API using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.

9) Error Handling and Validation:
    Implement error handling middleware to catch and handle errors.
    Validate incoming data using tools like express-validator.
    Ensure proper error messages are returned to the client.

10) Testing and Debugging:
    Write unit tests for your application using testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha.
    Set up integration tests to ensure the different components of your app work together correctly.
    Use debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix issues.

11) Deployment and Scalability:
    Prepare your app for deployment to a production environment.
    Set up a hosting platform or cloud service provider like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.
    Configure your server and database settings for production.
    Implement caching mechanisms or load balancing for scalability.

12) Security and Performance Optimization:
    Implement security best practices like input validation, CSRF protection, and rate limiting.
    Optimize your app's performance by caching, minimizing database queries, and optimizing code.
    Protect sensitive data and use encryption where necessary.

13) Monitoring and Logging:
    Set up logging and monitoring tools to track application behavior and detect issues.
    Implement logging of errors, warnings, and important events.
    Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic to monitor performance and resource usage.

14) Continued Maintenance and Updates:
    Regularly update dependencies and packages to maintain security and stability.
    Monitor community updates, security advisories, and patches for the frameworks and libraries you're using.
    Address user feedback and implement new features as needed.
